        <strong>Anomaly Code:</strong> ARC-303<br>

    <h2>1.0 ANOMALY DESCRIPTION</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1 Physical Description</h3>
    <p>
        ARC-303 is a temporal predator with no stable physical form. It cannot be fully seen; instead, it manifests as brief distortions in perception, like a heat shimmer in the air or a fleeting shadow caught in peripheral vision. When captured by recording devices, both image and sound are distorted, as if a tape had been overwritten multiple times. Rarely, in reflective surfaces (mirrors, puddles, polished metals), it appears momentarily as a vaguely humanoid silhouette, but its proportions are entirely wrong: its limbs are unnaturally long and thin, and its joints are in the wrong places. Where a face should be, there is only a smooth, light-absorbing void.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Anomalous Effect & Behavior</h3>
    <p>
        ARC-303 hunts humans, but does not target their bodies or lives. Instead, it consumes their personal timelines—memories, identity, and historical existence. This process occurs in three stages:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Stage 1: Marking:</strong> Once it selects a victim, it stalks them for days or even weeks. During this time, the victim experiences small but increasingly severe temporal anomalies in daily life.</p>
    <p><strong>Stage 2: Feeding:</strong> When the victim is sufficiently isolated and psychologically weakened, ARC-303 strikes. This is not a physical attack. The victim becomes suddenly paralyzed and feels their entire life flashing before their eyes—backwards.</p>
    <p><strong>Stage 3: Hollow Echo:</strong> After feeding, the victim does not die. Physically, they are unharmed. But they are no longer themselves—only a biological shell remains.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Discovery Summary</h3>
    <p>
        A.R.C. assigned a field agent to investigate a surge of “unidentified individuals” in the <span class="redacted">REDACTED</span> district of Istanbul. These cases matched no existing database entries. The agent’s final distorted transmission stated: “Command, listen… It’s here. In the reflection… in my reflection… I can see everything… it’s going backwards… my mother’s face… but… I’m forgetting… who am I… Command, I… I’m—” (Recording cuts off). The agent was found a day later as a “Hollow Echo.”
    </p>

    <h2>2.0 PROTOCOLS & OPERATIONAL HISTORY</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Protocol History: "Vanguard Protocol"</h3>
    <p>
        To study ARC-303, “Vanguard Protocol” was initiated, using Class-E test subjects implanted with miniature temporal sensors as bait. The protocol ended in complete failure, resulting in the loss of <span class="redacted">REDACTED</span> subjects and <span class="redacted">REDACTED</span> field support personnel.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 New Protocol: "Blind Eye Protocol"</h3>
    <p>
        Due to the low mental resilience of Class-E subjects, the most psychologically durable field agent, Agent Vesper, was selected as bait. Equipped with a Psycho-Chronometric Tracker implanted in the skull, Vesper was sent into the Absolute Isolation Zone. The mission’s objective was data collection until the moment of consumption—retrieval was not intended.

    <h2>3.0 ADDENDUM: CORRESPONDENCE ON "CHRONOS ANCHOR PROJECT"</h2>
    <div class="info-block">
        <strong>A.R.C. INTERNAL COMMUNICATION // TOP SECRET</strong><br><br>
        <strong>Date:</strong> 08.08.2025<br>
        <strong>From:</strong> Professor Aris Thorne<br>
        <strong>To:</strong> A.R.C. Council<br>
        <strong>Subject:</strong> URGENT CONCERN: Chronos Anchor Project - Phase II Testing<br><br>
        
        Council Members,<br><br>

        Based on data from Agent Vesper, simulations of the “Chronos Anchor” device reveal a catastrophic potential side effect. At the proposed frequency, there is a <span class="redacted">REDACTED</span>% chance of triggering an event we call the “<span class="redacted">REDACTED</span> Echo Cascade.”<br><br>

        This means that in attempting to trap the entity, we may implant a copy of it into a human host—potentially making it mobile. There is no guarantee such an entity would remain within the 200 km quarantine zone.<br><br>

        Continuing tests risks turning a contained T-2 threat into an uncontrollable T-3 threat. I strongly recommend halting the project immediately. This may be irreversible.<br><br>

        Respectfully,<br>
        Professor Aris Thorne

        Your concerns are noted.<br><br>

        The “<span class="redacted">REDACTED</span> Echo Cascade” risk is within acceptable parameters. Inaction is failure.<br><br>

        Proceed.
